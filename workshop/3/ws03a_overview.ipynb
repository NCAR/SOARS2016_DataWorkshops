    "> Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. ~ Muhammad Ali _(January 17, 1942 - June 3, 2016)_\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "* quick review of workshop 2 [exercises](https://github.com/NCAR/SOARS2016_DataWorkshops/tree/master/workshop/2/exercises) and my proposed [solutions]((https://github.com/NCAR/SOARS2016_DataWorkshops/tree/master/workshop/2/exercises/solutions.ipynb))\n",
    "* more [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org): merging, groupby and missing data\n",
    "* more [indexing, slicing and filtering](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#indexing-and-selecting-data) a Dataframe to get the data of interest\n",
    "* more stats operations ([describe()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.describe.html#pandas.DataFrame.describe), [mean()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.mean.html#pandas.DataFrame.mean), [median()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.median.html#pandas.DataFrame.median), etc.)\n",
    "* an introduction to basic plotting\n",
    "* (time permitting) plotting with [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)\n",
    "* (time permitting) an introduction to [Folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium)\n",

    "## Tools\n",
    "In this workshop we're going to go little deeper into Python for scientific computing.  In particular, we're going to talk about Jupyter Notebooks and Pandas.\n",

    "| Tool | Purpose |\n",
    "|------|---------|\n",
    "|matplotlib|[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) is the de facto plotting library for graphs, plots and charts.  It integrates directly into your notebook and plots can be exported into papers, websites, etc.|\n",
    "|Folium|[Folium](https://folium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a really excellent (albeit new and maturing) library for interactive map generation.  Not only is it coole, it is easy to use and get results fast.|\n",
    "|Jupyter Notebooks (NB)|[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org) are a compact, interactive way to allow you to do EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).  You can create notebooks that are private, share them on Github and [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)|\n",
    "|Pandas|[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) is a Python library that allows you to do data manipulations and provides basic statistical tools to operate over that data.  It will save us a lot of time, and some of the text file contortions we did in Workshop 1 will not longer be necessary. |\n",
