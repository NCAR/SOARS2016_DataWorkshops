# Workshop Information

All of the workshops are self-contained "modules" in the sense that that can be gone through alone (though each builds on the _concepts_ of the other.

You may want to spend a little time looking through the basic [installation](installation_notes.ipynb) so you have the correct components.  Pycharm is optional, but a nice to have if you plan to build more complex applications.

One will certainly need Conda and the included Jupyter Notebook.

## Viewing the workshops in Jupyter

The workshops are all in [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) and will be best viewed using this url :


* [Workshop 1](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/NCAR/SOARS2016_DataWorkshops/blob/master/workshop/1/ws01a_overview.ipynb)
* [Workshop 2](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/NCAR/SOARS2016_DataWorkshops/blob/master/workshop/2/ws02a_overview.ipynb)
* [Workshop 3](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/NCAR/SOARS2016_DataWorkshops/blob/master/workshop/3/ws03a_overview.ipynb)
* [Workshop 4](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/NCAR/SOARS2016_DataWorkshops/blob/master/workshop/4/ws04a_intro.ipynb)


Of course it is highly recommended you simply clone the repo and view the notebooks on your own local running Jupyter instance (or a remote server if you please).
