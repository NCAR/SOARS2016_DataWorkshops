    "### Lists again ...\n",
    "As we can see, lists are really important in Python.  So much so that the language has provided a shortcut to making lists easier when you need to compose one fast.  Let say we want to take the **list of strings** and make that a **list of lists**.  In other words, let's say we want our file to look like the list: [['120.04', '-42.8'], ['120.16', '-39.48'], ...].  Getting the list os strings into this form could be very valuable for searching, sorting, etc. down the road.  Let's look at the straightforward way to do this with just loops:\n"

To convert the loop above into a **list comprehension** we first must think from the outside and work our way in.
