# SOARS 2016 Data Workshops

The purpose of these workshops is to learn some of the tools and techniques for working with data in general.  The focus will initially be on ingesting, manipulating and handling data in text form with the [Python](http://www.python.org) programming language.

## Requirements
* [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) data analysis full installation is recommended
* (optional only if Anaconda fails to install ) a vanilla Python 2.7.12 [Win or OSX Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2712/)
* An editor (recommendation: [Pycharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download))

| Package | Purpose |
|:-------:|---------|
| Folium  | Interactive mapping |


## Resources
Continuously updated [list of resources](./workshop/resources) to use, add to, steal and learn from.

## Workshop Details

All of the workshops files are either in `.ipynb` or `md` format.  The core workshop files are best viewer in Jupyter Notebooks and it is **recommended you view files on Jupyter's NBViewer**.
